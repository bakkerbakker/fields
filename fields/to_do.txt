### Steps for getting code working

X Read in raster files
X - Currently stacked .tifs
- Will need to add a function to read in .jpg2000 or HDF5,
    whatever data type we decide to go with from the data pipeline
- Read as dask array

X Create mask
- NDVI stack
    - NDVI range
    - Is there a way to incorporate cumulative change?
- Edge map
    - Combine sum and max??
- Combine NDVI and Edges 
    - Combine NDVI range and Edges
- Need to test in non-ag dominated areas
    - Does it effectively mask out forest/other vegetation???
- Check min/max for other bands

X Segment the imagery
- skimage parameter testing

X Cluster segments
- Opportunity to explore methods here
- OBIA/eCognition methods

X Merge segments
- Need to investigate and improve this step
- Incorporate similarity across clustering variables and spatial proximity
- Need to add step to deal with small outlier segments
    - Perhaps a "fill holes" approach like in the raster to segments library

X Write to shapefile
- Might have to update this in cases where we use spatial subset that does not
    match the same "upper left" corner

X Evaluate accuracy and timing
- Spatial accuracy metrics
    - Boundary accuracy
    - Area accuracy
    - Oversegmentation/Undersegmentation
- Reference data
    - Need full shapefile of digitized fields
    - Add CDL data to digitized fields
- Timing


Data:
Get list of tile IDs for MN
Prep py file to run on MSI to access the stored data
GDAL process or xarray???

xarray
- get data loaded into xarray
    - select BGRN bands from granule
    - mosaic tiles
    - time stack tiles
    - what format? from jpg2000 in ESA granule to netCDF?? HDF5??
    - do we save out the mosaic?? (probably??)
dask
- get workflow processing into dask
- rewrite some of the mask/edge/ndvi to be more modular, 
  need to take a dask/xarray instead of reading tif directly
- this will mean reading in a file lazily, then doing the edge/ndvi on that, instead of on read
